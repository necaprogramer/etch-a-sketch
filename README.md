# etch-a-sketch

Etch a sketch is a project which is a part of TOP (The Odin project).

In this project I will try to use all my aquired skills and knowledge of DOM manipulation in order to create this page.

The task is to create a webpage with 16x16 grid of sqare divs. the divs are supposed to be made with JavaScript.
A "hover" effect is supposed to be placed on the squares so when the square is hovered upon it is supossed to change its color.
A button needs to be placed on top of the screen which will ask the user for number of squares per side for the new grid.
Once the user selects a new grid the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before.
The user can enter maximum of 100 squares.
